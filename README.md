## Document Organization
1. **Architecturally Important Aspects**  
   This section explains the most important qualities of the system — like safety, performance, reliability, and usability — and why they matter for the design.

2. **Proposed Solution**  
   Describes our main design idea, how the system is organized, and the reasoning behind the key choices we made.

3. **Alternative Solutions**  
   Covers other possible designs we considered and explains why we decided not to use them.

4. **Architectural Patterns / Styles**  
   Lists the architectural styles or patterns we chose (for example, client–server or layered) and explains why they fit the system’s goals.

5. **Lightweight Architecture Decision Record (ADR)**  
   Includes a short summary of one important design decision, what options we looked at, and the main trade-offs involved.
